Coursera project

The files in this branch are the files that I have created for the Data Scientist's Toolbox Coursera project. 
This was my first brush with git and it wasn't exactly a dawdle...but I got there in the end. I am using git bash to manage the repositories.

My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium and I am using git version 1.9.4. with git bash.
